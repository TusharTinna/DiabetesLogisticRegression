 # DiabetesLogisticRegression
This model uses Logistic Regression provided in Scikitlearn to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on given features. 
Diabetes Data set consisting of following features :'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age', 'Outcome'.
